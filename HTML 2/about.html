<h1>About Company</h1>
<p>Hey there, I'm John O'Reilly, the proud owner 
of Wheels on Fire.</p>
<p> I've been in the car 
business for as long as I can remember, and I 
love a well-tuned engine.<br> I’m a bit of a 
perfectionist — maybe even more with cars 
than with people, if I’m honest.<br>
I want to showcases my 
collection and help people find the perfect 
car, with a touch of my dry humour, of course.</p>
